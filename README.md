# Iris Classification

This is a simple web application to classify irises as virginica, versicolor or setosa. We need 4 features to achive this task. These features are sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. This application lets you fiddle with these features and see the prediction of a deep neural network for the values you pick.
